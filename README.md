Media Delivery Network Simulator
============================

The purpose of the project is to build a “life sized” simulation of Internet-based media distribution, with a flexible framework that will allow tinkering, experimentation and evolution.
It allows the user to experiment with different media delivery algorithms and different type of loads and get different metrics like packet loss, latency, transfer rate. These metrics can be used to figure out which delivery strategy works best in a given scenario.

For more details, please refer the docs folder.
